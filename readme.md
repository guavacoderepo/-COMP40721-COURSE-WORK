## Project Description

This project (coursework) focuses on applying various machine learning (ML) models to analyze and predict developers' annual compensation. The study leverages data from the "Stack Overflow 2024 Annual Developer Survey", which captures information about the annual salaries of developers from diverse countries, industries, skills, and experience levels. 

The primary objectives of this coursework include performing Clustering Analysis (Unsupervised Learning) to group developers based on similar compensation patterns, Classification (Supervised Learning) to categorize developers into high and low-income groups, and Regression Analysis (Supervised Learning) to predict their annual compensation.
